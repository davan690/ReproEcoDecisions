# ReproEcoDecisions

Are ecological decisions reproducible? A systematic literature review. This project will be fully reproducible, of course.

## About the setup of this repository

This repository is set up with multiple-layered workflows:

1. A fully reproducible data-analysis pipe-line, implementing all stages of the systematic literature review process from planning and protocol development, to scoping exercises, analysis, inferencing and manuscript generation, accompanied by a:
2. `workflowr`-generated website
2. A package-like implementation, containing:

`/R` and `/data` and `/man` folders, containing all the necessary documented R functions I write to implement this literature review.
