This is a mini-analysis to take a look at 


## Collect list of articles

ALSO: check out metagear package for screening studies.

Following S2 of Guerrero  et al. [-@Guerrero:2017gm] I generate a list of articles using the following search bounds:

```
- Database:
- Years
- select article if keywords or abstract contains:
"conservation" or "ecology" or "restoration"
AND
"decision support" or "decision analysis" or "decision theory" or "decision science"
AND
within these subject areas: "Biodiversity & Conservation" 
```

```{r}
#library(metagear) #currently install issues on this
library(fulltext)
library(tidyverse)
res1 <- fulltext::ft_search(query = "ecology AND conservation AND decision science")
res1$plos
out <- ft_get(res1)
out$plos
```
